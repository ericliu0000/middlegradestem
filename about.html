    <h1>Meet the Team</h1>
    <p>Middle Grade STEM is a FREE, volunteering organization led by high school students. Our goal is to provide more interest in STEM-related topics, such as programming, math and science. We have successfully been hosting public classes and private tutoring for a YEAR now, with over 50 students signing up for our classes.</p>
    <p>We began this program as a result of the circumstances surrounding COVID-19 in 2020. Many opportunities that people had were either postponed or cancelled altogether for middle school students. Because we have personally felt the struggle of the lack of STEM opportunities, our co-founders Helen and Sarayu decided to co-found this organization, along with many other teachers/tutors ranging all over the RTP area. Below is some information about each of the members that have helped make Middle Grade STEM into what it is today.</p>

        <h3>Helen Wu</h3>
        <h4>Co-founder/Public Class Instructor</h4>
        <p>Hi! My name is Helen, and I am a junior at the North Carolina School of Science and Math, previously being at Panther Creek. <!--I will be teaching/assisting the public classes.--> My extracurricular activities include game design, programming, and digital art.</p>
        <p>I have received A's as of my high school career thus far, including subjects such as AP Calculus, AP Chemistry, etc. I began learning programming and coding in middle school, and I am well-versed in Python, HTML/CSS, and a little Java. In sophomore year, I was the team captain for a SciVis team (digital cartoon) that earned 3rd place in TSA Nationals.</p>
        <p>I believe middle school is the ideal time to begin learning programming and coding principles. Beginning those few crucial steps into the STEM world can be difficult, so I am here to make sure it isn't as harrowing for future STEM enthusiasts! Hope to see you in class!</p>

        <h3>Sarayu Kondaveeti</h3>
        <h4>Co-founder/Public Class Instructor</h4>
        <p>Hi! I am Sarayu, one of the co-founders of this program. I teach/assist some of the classes here at Middle Grade STEM, as well as helping run the program. </p>
        <p>I am a junior at Green Level High School with a 4.5 GPA and have been earning all A's in my classes since sixth grade. In addition to my academics, I take violin lessons, teach violin, play softball, have a job with a the town of Cary, am a part of Varsity Science Olympiad and a member of the SNHS board!</p>
        <p>I believe middle school is the ideal time to develop a solid academic foundation and for students interested in STEM to be introduced to its different aspects. The opportunity to do so shouldn't have money as a barrier, and to make these things more accessible, all the services offered by Middle Grade STEM are free.</p>

        <h3>Devika Venugopalan</h3>
        <h4>Private Tutoring Instructor</h4>
        <p>Hi! My name is Devika, and I am a junior at Panther Creek High School.</p>
        <p>I have made all high A's in my classes since middle school. Math is my favorite subject, and I have already taken many high school math courses, including NC Math 1, Math 2, Math 3, Precalculus, and AP Calculus. </p>
        <p>I believe Middle School is when students get introduced to many new math concepts that will be used in their math classes throughout high school. These concepts tend to build on each other, so it is very important to understand everything fully before moving onto the next level. Middle-Grade STEM allows students to get any help they need in their math classes or stay ahead of the game, for free!</p>
        <p>In school, I participate in several clubs, like Key Club, TSA, Science Club, and Math Club. Outside of school, I enjoy reading, doing art, playing the piano, and dancing.</p>
